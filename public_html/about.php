            <p class="mycolor col-xs-12 col-md-6">John Smith was born on October 29, 1976, in Boston, Massachusetts. His father, James Smith, was a high school math teacher, while his mother, Jane Smith, was a college anthropology professor. John lived in Boston with his parents and sister, Janice Smith, until he moved to the West Coast to attend college at the University of California, Berkeley. There, he studied history and graduated with a Ph.D. in 2003. Whilst in school, John discovered that he enjoyed writing fiction and often wrote as a means of relaxation. As a result, John wrote his first and second novels during the course of his graduate program. At the prompting of his advisor, Dr. Jordan Perry, he sent copies of his novels to multiple publishers before the manuscripts were picked up by Tenor Publishing. He now lives in Salem, Massachusetts, with his wife, Jamie, and their two children, Jack and Jill. Much to the delight of his fans, he still finds pleasure in writing fiction.</p>
